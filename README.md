## 💾 Database Schema

The system uses **SQLite** for a lightweight and embedded database. The schema is organized into five main tables:

* **USERS**: Stores login credentials and user roles.
* **PATIENTS**: Contains patient-specific demographic data.
* **DOCTORS**: Stores doctor information, including specialty.
* **APPOINTMENTS**: Records all scheduled appointments.
* **AVAILABILITY_SLOTS**: Manages a doctor's available time slots and their booking status.
